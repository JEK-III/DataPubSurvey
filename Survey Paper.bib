	abstract = {Since the 1660’s the scientific method has included reproducibility as a mainstay in its effort to root error from scientific discovery. With the explosive growth of digitization in scientific research and communication, it is easier than ever to satisfy this requirement. In computational research experimental details and methods can be recorded in code and scripts, data is digital, papers are frequently online, and the result is the potential for “really reproducible research.”  Imagine the ability to routinely inspect code and data and recreate others’ results: Every step taken to achieve the findings can potentially be transparent. Now imagine anyone with an Internet connection and the capability of running the code being able to do this.This paper investigates the obstacles blocking the sharing of code and data to understand conditions under which computational scientists reveal their full research compendium. A survey of registrants at a top machine learning conference ({NIPS}) was used to discover the strength of underlying factors that affect the decision to reveal code, data, and ideas. Sharing of code and data is becoming more common as about a third of respondents post some on their websites, and about 85\% self report to have some code or data publicly available on the web. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the decision to share work is grounded in communitarian norms, although when work remains hidden private incentives dominate the decision. We find that code, data, and ideas are each regarded differently in terms of how they are revealed and that guidance from scientific norms varies with pervasiveness of computation in the field. The largest barriers to sharing are time involved in preparation of work and the legal Intellectual Property framework scientists face.This paper does two things. It provides evidence in the debate about whether scientists’ research revealing behavior is wholly governed by considerations of personal impact or whether the reasoning behind the revealing decision involves larger scientific ideals, and secondly, this research describes the actual sharing behavior in the Machine Learning community.},

	abstract = {Background
Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. 

Methodology/Principal Findings
A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. 

Conclusions/Significance
Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from {NSF} and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the {NSF}-sponsored {DataNET} (including projects like {DataONE}) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

	abstract = {Context The free and open sharing of information, data, and materials regarding published research is vital to the replication of published results, the efficient advancement of science, and the education of students. Yet in daily practice, the ideal of free sharing is often breached.Objective To understand the nature, extent, and consequences of data withholding in academic genetics.Design, Setting, and Participants Mailed survey (March-July 2000) of geneticists and other life scientists in the 100 {US} universities that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1998. Of a potential 3000 respondents, 2893 were eligible and 1849 responded, yielding an overall response rate of 64\%. We analyzed a subsample of 1240 self-identified geneticists and made a limited number of comparisons with 600 self-identified nongeneticists.Main Outcome Measures Percentage of faculty who made requests for data that were denied; percentage of respondents who denied requests; influences on and consequences of withholding data; and changes over time in perceived willingness to share data.Results Forty-seven percent of geneticists who asked other faculty for additional information, data, or materials regarding published research reported that at least 1 of their requests had been denied in the preceding 3 years. Ten percent of all postpublication requests for additional information were denied. Because they were denied access to data, 28\% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research. Twelve percent said that in the previous 3 years, they had denied another academician's request for data concerning published results. Among geneticists who said they had intentionally withheld data regarding their published work, 80\% reported that it required too much effort to produce the materials or information; 64\%, that they were protecting the ability of a graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, or junior faculty member to publish; and 53\%, that they were protecting their own ability to publish. Thirty-five percent of geneticists said that sharing had decreased during the last decade; 14\%, that sharing had increased. Geneticists were as likely as other life scientists to deny others' requests (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.39; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.81-2.40) and to have their own requests denied ({OR}, 0.97; 95\% {CI}, 0.69-1.40). However, other life scientists were less likely to report that withholding had a negative impact on their own research as well as their field of research.Conclusions Data withholding occurs in academic genetics and it affects essential scientific activities such as the ability to confirm published results. Lack of resources and issues of scientific priority may play an important role in scientists' decisions to withhold data, materials, and information from other academic geneticists.},

	abstract = {Background
There is increasing interest to make primary data from published research publicly available. We aimed to assess the current status of making research data available in highly-cited journals across the scientific literature.


Methods and Results
We reviewed the first 10 original research papers of 2009 published in the 50 original research journals with the highest impact factor. For each journal we documented the policies related to public availability and sharing of data. Of the 50 journals, 44 (88\%) had a statement in their instructions to authors related to public availability and sharing of data. However, there was wide variation in journal requirements, ranging from requiring the sharing of all primary data related to the research to just including a statement in the published manuscript that data can be available on request. Of the 500 assessed papers, 149 (30\%) were not subject to any data availability policy. Of the remaining 351 papers that were covered by some data availability policy, 208 papers (59\%) did not fully adhere to the data availability instructions of the journals they were published in, most commonly (73\%) by not publicly depositing microarray data. The other 143 papers that adhered to the data availability instructions did so by publicly depositing only the specific data type as required, making a statement of willingness to share, or actually sharing all the primary data. Overall, only 47 papers (9\%) deposited full primary raw data online. None of the 149 papers not subject to data availability policies made their full primary data publicly available.


Conclusion
A substantial proportion of original research papers published in high-impact journals are either not subject to any data availability policies, or do not adhere to the data availability instructions in their respective journals. This empiric evaluation highlights opportunities for improvement.},

	title = {Faculty/Researcher Survey on Data Curation},
	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.5062/F4PN93K4},
	abstract = {In 2012 the Data Curation @ {UCSB} Project surveyed {UCSB} campus faculty and researchers on the subject of data curation, with the goals of 1) better understanding the scope of the digital curation problem and the curation services that are needed, and 2) characterizing the role that the {UCSB} Library might play in supporting curation of campus research outputs. The project received responses from one-third of the estimated target audience of 900, indicating great interest in the topic and yielding statistically significant results. To summarize the survey's findings:

    Curation of digital data is a concern for a significant proportion of {UCSB} faculty and researchers.
    Curation of digital data is a concern for almost every department and unit on campus.
    Researchers almost universally view themselves as personally responsible for the curation of their data.
    Researchers view curation as a collaborative activity and collective responsibility.
    Departments have different curation requirements, and therefore may require different amounts and types of campus support.
    Researchers desire help with all data management activities related to curation, predominantly storage.
    Researchers may be underestimating the need for help using archival storage systems and dealing with attendant metadata issues.
    There are many sources of curation mandates, and researchers are increasingly under mandate to curate their data.
    Researchers under curation mandate are more likely to collaborate with other parties in curating their data, including with their local labs and departments.
    Researchers under curation mandate request more help with all curation-related activities; put another way, curation mandates are an effective means of raising curation awareness.
    The survey reflects the concerns of a broad cross-section of campus.

These findings echo and complement similar surveys performed by other higher education institutions, including surveys at the University of Colorado, Boulder [4], California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo [7], Georgia Tech [8], and University of Oxford [9], as well as the Digital Curator Vocational Education Europe ({DigCurV}) Project [2].

Taken together, these findings argue for the establishment of a campus unit possessing data curation expertise and providing curation-related assistance to campus researchers, and possibly hosting curation services (as necessary and as funding allows).},

This paper describes information gathered from a survey distributed to the College of Science and Mathematics faculty at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly), a master’s-granting, teaching-centered institution. There was a more than 60 percent response rate to the survey. The survey results provided insight into the science researchers’ data curation awareness, behaviors, and attitudes, as well as what needs they exhibited for services and education regarding maintenance and management of data. It is important that professional librarians understand what researchers both inside and outside their own institutions know so that they can collaborate with their university colleagues to examine data curation needs.},

	abstract = {Computational science and raw and derivative scientific data are increasingly important to the research enterprise of higher education institutions. Academic libraries are beginning to examine what the expansion of data-intensive e-science means to scholarly communication and information services, and some are reshaping their own programmes to support the digital curation needs of research staff. These changes in libraries may involve repurposing or leveraging existing services, and the development or acquisition of new skills, roles, and organisational structures [1].

Scientific research data management is a fluid and evolving endeavour, reflective of the high rate of change in the information technology landscape, increasing levels of multi-disciplinary research, complex data structures and linkages, advances in data visualisation and analysis, and new tools capable of generating or capturing massive amounts of data.

These factors can create a complex and challenging environment for managing data, and one in which libraries can have a significant positive role supporting e-science. A needs assessment can help to characterise scientists' research methods and data management practices, highlighting gaps and barriers [2], and thereby improve the odds for libraries to plan appropriately and effectively implement services in the local setting [3].},

	abstract = {{BackgroundThe} pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries depend on findings from academic investigators prior to initiating programs to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic agents to benefit cancer patients. The success of these programs depends on the validity of published findings. This validity, represented by the reproducibility of published findings, has come into question recently as investigators from companies have raised the issue of poor reproducibility of published results from academic laboratories. Furthermore, retraction rates in high impact journals are climbing.Methods and {FindingsTo} examine a microcosm of the academic experience with data reproducibility, we surveyed the faculty and trainees at {MD} Anderson Cancer Center using an anonymous computerized questionnaire; we sought to ascertain the frequency and potential causes of non-reproducible data. We found that ∼50\% of respondents had experienced at least one episode of the inability to reproduce published data; many who pursued this issue with the original authors were never able to identify the reason for the lack of reproducibility; some were even met with a less than “collegial” interaction.{ConclusionsThese} results suggest that the problem of data reproducibility is real. Biomedical science needs to establish processes to decrease the problem and adjudicate discrepancies in findings when they are discovered.},
