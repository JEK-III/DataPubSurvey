	abstract = {Background
Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. 

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. 

{Conclusions/Significance}
Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from {NSF} and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the {NSF-sponsored} {DataNET} (including projects like {DataONE)} will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

Of a potential 3000 respondents, 2893 were eligible and 1849 responded, yielding an overall response rate of 64\%. We analyzed a subsample of 1240 self-identified geneticists and made a limited number of comparisons with 600 self-identified {nongeneticists.Main} Outcome Measures Percentage of faculty who made requests for data that were denied; percentage of respondents who denied requests; influences on and consequences of withholding data; and changes over time in perceived willingness to share {data.Results} Forty-seven percent of geneticists who asked other faculty for additional information, data, or materials regarding published research reported that at least 1 of their requests had been denied in the preceding 3 years. Ten percent of all postpublication requests for additional information were denied. Because they were denied access to data, 28\% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research. Twelve percent said that in the previous 3 years, they had denied another academician's request for data concerning published results. Among geneticists who said they had intentionally withheld data regarding their published work, 80\% reported that it required too much effort to produce the materials or information; 64\%, that they were protecting the ability of a graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, or junior faculty member to publish; and 53\%, that they were protecting their own ability to publish. Thirty-five percent of geneticists said that sharing had decreased during the last decade; 14\%, that sharing had increased. Geneticists were as likely as other life scientists to deny others' requests (odds ratio [{OR]}, 1.39; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.81-2.40) and to have their own requests denied ({OR}, 0.97; 95\% {CI}, 0.69-1.40). However, other life scientists were less likely to report that withholding had a negative impact on their own research as well as their field of {research.Conclusions} Data withholding occurs in academic genetics and it affects essential scientific activities such as the ability to confirm published results. Lack of resources and issues of scientific priority may play an important role in scientists' decisions to withhold data, materials, and information from other academic geneticists.},

	title = {{Faculty/Researcher} Survey on Data Curation},
	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.5062/F4PN93K4},
	abstract = {In 2012 the Data Curation @ {UCSB} Project surveyed {UCSB} campus faculty and researchers on the subject of data curation, with the goals of 1) better understanding the scope of the digital curation problem and the curation services that are needed, and 2) characterizing the role that the {UCSB} Library might play in supporting curation of campus research outputs. The project received responses from one-third of the estimated target audience of 900, indicating great interest in the topic and yielding statistically significant results. To summarize the survey's findings:

    Curation of digital data is a concern for a significant proportion of {UCSB} faculty and researchers.
    Curation of digital data is a concern for almost every department and unit on campus.
    Researchers almost universally view themselves as personally responsible for the curation of their data.
    Researchers view curation as a collaborative activity and collective responsibility.
    Departments have different curation requirements, and therefore may require different amounts and types of campus support.
    Researchers desire help with all data management activities related to curation, predominantly storage.
    Researchers may be underestimating the need for help using archival storage systems and dealing with attendant metadata issues.
    There are many sources of curation mandates, and researchers are increasingly under mandate to curate their data.
    Researchers under curation mandate are more likely to collaborate with other parties in curating their data, including with their local labs and departments.
    Researchers under curation mandate request more help with all curation-related activities; put another way, curation mandates are an effective means of raising curation awareness.
    The survey reflects the concerns of a broad cross-section of campus.

These findings echo and complement similar surveys performed by other higher education institutions, including surveys at the University of Colorado, Boulder [4], California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo [7], Georgia Tech [8], and University of Oxford [9], as well as the Digital Curator Vocational Education Europe ({DigCurV)} Project [2].

Taken together, these findings argue for the establishment of a campus unit possessing data curation expertise and providing curation-related assistance to campus researchers, and possibly hosting curation services (as necessary and as funding allows).},

Academic libraries are beginning to examine what the expansion of data-intensive e-science means to scholarly communication and information services, and some are reshaping their own programmes to support the digital curation needs of research staff. These changes in libraries may involve repurposing or leveraging existing services, and the development or acquisition of new skills, roles, and organisational structures [1].

Scientific research data management is a fluid and evolving endeavour, reflective of the high rate of change in the information technology landscape, increasing levels of multi-disciplinary research, complex data structures and linkages, advances in data visualisation and analysis, and new tools capable of generating or capturing massive amounts of data.

These factors can create a complex and challenging environment for managing data, and one in which libraries can have a significant positive role supporting e-science. A needs assessment can help to characterise scientists' research methods and data management practices, highlighting gaps and barriers [2], and thereby improve the odds for libraries to plan appropriately and effectively implement services in the local setting [3].},
