\section*{Abstract}

Data ``publication'' attempts to appropriate for data the prestige of publication in the scholarly literature. 
While the scholarly communication community substantially endorses the idea, it hasn't fully resolved what a data publication should look like or how data peer review should work. 
To contribute an important and neglected perspective on these issues, we surveyed ~250 researchers across the sciences and social sciences, asking what expectations``data publication'' raises and what features would be useful to evaluate the trustworthiness and impact of a data publication and the contribution of its creator(s).  
We found that expectations of data publication center on availability.
Most respondents did not expect published data to be peer-reviewed, but peer review was the significant source of trust and value for a published dataset.


\section*{Introduction}

% Results and Discussion can be combined.
\section*{Results}
To find out what data publication and peer review means to researchers, we conducted an online survey in January and February of 2014.


\subsection*{Demographics}
We received 281 unique responses to the survey.
We analyzed the responses of 249 (81\%) of these who were deemed to be active researchers (summarized in Table 1).
The largest response was from biologists (37\%), followed by Archaeologists (13\%), Social scientists (13\%), and Envirnomental scientists (11\%).
Most (85\%) of the respondents were affiliated with academic institutions; 90\% of those are research-focused (rather than teaching).
Respondents covered the academic career spectrum: 41\% are principal investigators/lab heads, 24\% postdocs, and 16\% grad students.
We saw surprisingly few significant differences in response between disciplines or roles, so the results are presented in aggregate.
Because these policies are specific to the 

\subsection*{Background knowledge}

We asked a number of questions to gauge respondents engagement and familiarity with issues around data sharing and publication.
Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity with three United States (US) federal government policies related to data sharing and availability.
Because the policies are specific to the US, we restricted our analysis to the 79\% (197) of repondents who work in the US.
The best known was the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Data Management Plan requirement\cite{national_science_foundation_gpg_2011}.
Less than half of the respondents had heard of the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Open Data Initiative\cite{obama_making_2013} at all; this may be because the directive has not had any concrete effect on researchers yet, even though it will eventually affect virtually everyone doing research in the US.
On the other hand, even though the National Institutes of Health (NIH) data sharing policy\cite{national_institutes_of_health_final_2003} was enacted 11 years ago, only 4 (5\%) biologists claimed to `know all the details,' while 18 (24\%) had `never heard of it.'

Because data papers are a rapidly proliferating form of data publication that has been gaining attention, we asked about data journals specifically.
We provided a free text box and asked respondents to list any data journals that they could name.
Only 16\% of respondents named a data journal; \emph{Ecological Archives} was the most frequently named, by 16 respondents. 
The second most common response was Nature Publishing Group (NPG)'s \emph{Scientific Data} (named by 14), even though it had not started publishing at the time of the survey.
\emph{Earth System Science Data (ESSD)} (7), \emph{Biodiversity Data Journal} (6) and \emph{Geoscience Data Journal} (5) followed.
A number of respondents listed non-journal data publishers: figshare (6), Dryad (3), and Zenodo(1).

\section*{Materials and Methods}
All results were drawn from a 34-question survey officially open online from January 22nd to February 28 of 2014; two late responses recieved in March were included in the analysis.
The University of California, Berkeley Insitiutional Review Board approved the survey.
The survey could be completed anonymously.
Respondends affiliated with the Univeristy of California had an opportunity to supply an email address for help with data publication, but that information was not used in any way for the purposes of this article.

The survey asked questions in 3 categores: demographics, data sharing experience, and data publication perceptions.
Data publication perceptions consisted of ``mark all that apply'' questions about the definition of data publication and peer review and Likert scale questions about the value of various possible features of a data publication.

The survey was designed with a minimum of required questions.
Some pages were displayed dynamically based on answers to certain questions; therefore, n varies considerably.
The survey was administered as a Google Form.
Solicitations were distributed via social media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+), emails to listservs, and a blog post on Data Pub\cite{kratz_data_2014}.

Although opinions are unlikely to be controversial, light anonymization was performed prior to analysis.
University of California (UC) affiliation and questions with specific application to UC researchers were redacted.
Respondent locations were grouped into United States and ``Other''; this distinction was preserved because some questions asked about US government policies.  
Sub-disciplines with fewer than three respondents were merged into the corresponding discipline.
Listed data journals were standardized by hand.
Free text answers were replaced with ``Other.''

After anonymization, reponses were filtered for analysis.
Because the goal of the survey was to learn about researchers, we exempted from analysis anyone who self-identified as a librarian or information scientist.
To restrict the analysis to active researchers, we filtered anyone who affirmed that they had not generated any data in the last five years; the 90 respondents who did not answer this question were retained.
Finally, we exempted anyone who did not posess at least a Bachelor's Degree.
In total, 32 respondents were exempted from analysis, some on the basis of multiple criteria.

Analysis was performed using IPython\cite{perez_ipython_2007}, Pandas\cite{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}, and Numpy\cite{van_der_walt_numpy_2011}.
Graphs were prepared using Python and formatted with Adobe Illustrator.
For significance testing, the Fisher exact test was used for 2x2 tables and contingency table chi-square for all larger tables.
A significance cutoff of \alpha=0.05 was used, corrected for multiple hypothesis testing when appropriate.
Because few questions were required, questions with no reply at all were considered to be skipped rather than an intentional ``none of these''.
