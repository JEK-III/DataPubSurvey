\section*{Materials and Methods}
All results were drawn from a 34-question survey officially open online from January 22nd to February 28 of 2014; two late responses recieved in March were included in the analysis.
The University of California, Berkeley Insitiutional Review Board approved the survey.
The survey could be completed anonymously.
Respondends affiliated with the Univeristy of California had an opportunity to supply an email address for help with data publication, but that information was not used in any way for the purposes of this article.
