\section*{Abstract}

Data ``publication'' attempts to appropriate for data the prestige of publication in the scholarly literature. 
While the scholarly communication community substantially endorses the idea, it hasn't fully resolved what a data publication should look like or how data peer review should work. 
To contribute an important and neglected perspective on these issues, we surveyed ~250 researchers across the sciences and social sciences, asking what expectations``data publication'' raises and what features would be useful to evaluate the trustworthiness and impact of a data publication and the contribution of its creator(s).  
We found that expectations of data publication center on availability.
Most respondents did not expect published data to be peer-reviewed, but peer review was the significant source of trust and value for a published dataset.



\section*{Introduction}

% Results and Discussion can be combined.
\section*{Results}
To find out what data publication and peer review means to researchers, we conducted an online survey in January and February of 2014.

\subsection*{Demographics}

We received 281 unique responses to the survey.
Because in most cases we did not contact potential respondents directly, but rather asked colleagues to forward the request on and posted on social media, we cannot estimate in any reasonable way how many researchers were ultimately contacted and therefore cannot calculate a response rate.
We analyzed the responses of 249 (81\%) of these who were deemed to be active researchers (summarized in Table 1).
The largest response was from biologists (37\%), followed by Archaeologists (13\%), Social scientists (13\%), and Envirnomental scientists (11\%).
Most (85\%) of the respondents were affiliated with academic institutions; 90\% of those are research-focused (rather than teaching).
Respondents covered the academic career spectrum: 41\% are principal investigators/lab heads, 24\% postdocs, and 16\% grad students.
We saw surprisingly few significant differences in response between disciplines or roles, so the results are presented in aggregate.
We recieved responses from 20 countries, but the overwhelming majority (79\%, 197) are from the United States (US).

\subsection*{Background knowledge}

We asked a number of questions to gauge respondents engagement and familiarity with issues around data sharing and publication.
Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity with three United States (US) federal government policies related to data sharing and availability.
Because the policies are specific to the US, we restricted our analysis to the repondents who work in the US.
The best known was the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Data Management Plan requirement\cite{national_science_foundation_gpg_2011}.
Less than half of the respondents had heard of the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Open Data Initiative\cite{obama_making_2013} at all; this may be because the directive has not had any concrete effect on researchers yet, even though it will eventually affect virtually everyone doing research in the US.
On the other hand, even though the National Institutes of Health (NIH) data sharing policy\cite{national_institutes_of_health_final_2003} was enacted 11 years ago, only 4 (5\%) biologists claimed to `know all the details,' while 18 (24\%) had `never heard of it.'

Because data papers are a rapidly proliferating form of data publication that has been gaining attention, we asked about data journals specifically.
We provided a free text box and asked respondents to list any data journals that they could name.
Only 16\% of respondents named a data journal; \emph{Ecological Archives} was the most frequently named, by 16 respondents. 
The second most common response was Nature Publishing Group (NPG)'s \emph{Scientific Data} (named by 14), even though it had not started publishing at the time of the survey.
\emph{Earth System Science Data (ESSD)} (7), \emph{Biodiversity Data Journal} (6) and \emph{Geoscience Data Journal} (5) followed.
A number of respondents listed non-journal data publishers: figshare (6), Dryad (3), and Zenodo(1).

\subsection*{Data sharing mechanisms}

One of the goals of this survey was to explore the distinction between data sharing and publication.
Unlike data publication, a relatively new and unfamiliar concept to researchers, most have experience with and opinions about data sharing.
Many respondents (56\%, 140) said that it is very important to share the data that underlies a study; we did not see any statistically meaningful difference between disciplines ($\chi^{2}= 39.1, p= 0.18$). %Check that these values makes sense!
A majority (68\%, 168) have shared data in the past.
Of those, 58\% (98) saw their data reused by someone, and 62\% (61) of those reuses led to publication.
Slightly fewer, 61\% (151) had reused someone else's data; 69\% (104) of these led to a publication.

Because the channel of sharing is a crucial feature of data publication <CITE>, we asked about sharing channels (Figure 2).
We asked how respondents shared data, how others got their data, and how they got others data.
We provided four answers that correspond to the four methods for external data sharing that emerged from interviews by Kim\cite{kim_institutional_2012}: email/direct contact, database or repository, and journal website.
In all cases, email/direct contact was the most frequently reported channel for sharing; 87\% (146) shared data that way, 82\% (82) reported that others got their data that way, and 57\% (86) reused data that they got that way.
As a fifth alternative, 5\% (8) respondents wrote-in that they had extracted data from the text, tables, or figures of a published paper.

\subsection*{Data sharing credit}

A primary goal of data publication is to enable researchers who do the work needed to make data reusable to get credit for their work.
We wanted to assess what the researchers taking our survey thought was appropriate credit for the creators of a dataset.
We asked how a researcher who shares data should be credited.
Formal citation in the reference list was the most common answer, given by 83\% (126)
Acknowledgement also ranked highly at 62\% (93)
The most common actual practice observed by examining published articles, informal reference in the body of the paper\cite{sieber_not_1995, mooney_anatomy_2012}, ranked lowest at 16\% (24).
Respondents who used the provided free-text field overwhemlingly wrote some variant on ``it depends.''
Two factors were cited: the publication status of the dataset (e.g. ``depends on whether the data is already published'') and the role of the data in the paper (e.g. ``authorship if data is [the] primary source of analysis, otherwise acknowledgment'').
Becase previous studies identified substantial differences in culture between disciplines\cite{harley_assessing_2010, swan_share_2008}, we tested for significant differences between disciplines (omitting Mathematics because the \emph{n} was too low for chi-square), but did not find any ($\chi^{2}= 15.6, p= 0.9$).

We also asked the subset who had published with someone else's data how they actually credited the creators.
The answers to this question corresponded well with the prior theoretical question.
Formal citation was the most frequently reported, by 63\% (81), followed by acknowledgment (LOOK UP).
No one admited to citing data informally in the body of the text.

Fear of `data vultures' appropriating and profiting from one's data without adequately acknowledging the source is a significant concern for researchers <CITATION NEEDED>, but we wanted to know how significant the problem really is.
To address this question, we asked respondents whose data had been reused in a publication how they felt about the amount of credit given.
Most of the 86 who answered the question, 63\% (54) felt that they had been credited appropriately, and a combined 78\% (67) thought they recieved appropriate or excessive credit.
This left 22\% (13) who felt that they recieved insufficent credit; only 2 (2\%) felt that the credit was `very insufficent.'
We considered the possibility that differences in satisfaction were driven by different attitudes toward what constitutes appropriate credit.  
To that end, we collapsed responses into three categories (insufficient, appropriate, and excessive), and tested for independence with each of the four specified answers in data sharing credit.
The strongest relationship, between less satisfaction and ``authorship on paper,'' was still far from statisctially significant ($\chi^{2}= 3.26, p= 0.20$, corrected $\$alpha= 0.0125$).

\subsection*{Definitions}

Because the application of ``publication'' and ``peer review'' to data is largely based on the familiarity of these ideas to researchers, we wanted to know what ``data publication'' and ``peer review of data'' would actually mean to researchers.
We decomposed the prevalent models of data publication into a set of separate features and asked which would be expected to distinguish a ``published'' dataset from a ``shared'' one (Figure XXXA).
Not surprisingly, the most common expectations relate to access: 68\% (166) expect a published dataset to be openly available and 54\% (133) expect it to have been deposited in a repository.
More researchers expected a published dataset to accompanied by a traditional publication (43\%, 105) than a data paper (22\%, 55).
Perhaps surprisingly, only a 29\% (70) minority expect published data to have been peer reviewed.

To find out what researchers expected from data peer review, we asked what they would expect peer review of data to entail and provided a list of considerations that various organizations take into account when evaluating/validating datasets (Figure XXXB).
The most common responses were ``collection and processing methods were evaluated'' (90\%, 220) and ``descriptive text is thorough enough to use or replicate the dataset'' (80\%, 196).
The high rank of the latter suggests an awareness of the importance of metadata.
Fitting with current practice, there was little (22\%, 53) expectation that peer review would consider the novely or potential impact of the dataset.
An expectation that data publication includes peer review correlated postively (by Fisher exact test) with thorough descriptive text ($OR= 5.67, p= 0.00029$), plausibility considered ($OR= 2.29, p= 0.0087$), and novelty/impact considered ($OR= 2.42, p= 0.0092$), although only the first edges over an $\alpha= 0.05$ signficance threshold after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing.

We were interested in whether selections of items in each definition represented coherent ideas about publication or peer review, so we tested agains the null hypothesis that each item was selected (or not) independently of every other.
Not surprisingly, this hypothesis was rejected resoundingly for both data publication ($\chi^{2}$= 290.0, $p= 6.9\times10^{-58}$) and peer review ($\chi^{2}= 343.0, p= 5.7\times10^{-72}$) by chi square tests.
To identify specific correlations, we performed pairwise Fisher exact tests between each feature (Figure XXX).
We found a dense set of statistically significant (at the $\alpha= 0.05$ level, corrected to 0.0018) associates among features related to access and preservation.
For instance, ``deposited in a repository'' was linked to ``openly available'' ($OR=9.55, p= 7.6\times10^{-14}$), unique ID ($OR= 3.33, p= 1.33\times10^{-5}$), formal ($OR= 4.49, p= 3.94\times10^{-6}$) and rich ($OR= 3.83, p=1.14\times10^{-6}$) metadata.
We were unsurprised to find linkages between formal and rich metadata ($OR= 12.5, p= 2.7\times10^{-14}$) and between assignment of a unique ID and formal metadata ($OR= 7.92, p= 5.05\times10^{-11}$).
Data papers were linked to both rich ($OR=3.64, p=4.22\times10^{-5}$) and formal ($OR=4.30, p=1.32\times10^{-5}$) metadata.
Data papers were also the only feature associated with peer review ($OR=3.00, p=0.0011$).
``Basis of a traditional paper'' had no significant associations; the closest was with data paper ($OR=1.93, p=0.023$).

We also found multiple significant relationships among possible considerations for peer review, with a corrected cutoff of $\alpha=0.0033$.
Three strong correlations formed a triangle from ``methods are appropriate'' to ``Metadata standardized'' ($OR=7.91, p=0.00081$) to ``Technical details check out'' ($OR=4.56, p=3.4\times10^{-6}$) to ``methods are appropriate'' ($OR=5.9, p=7.9\times10^{-5}$).
``Data is plausible'' correlated with other factors that require domain expertise: ``methods are appropriate'' ($OR=4.51, p=0.0014$), ``metadata sufficient for replication'' ($OR=4.87, p=2.5\time10^{-6}$), and ``novelty/impact'' ($OR=5.50, p=1.1\times10^{-5}$).
Interestingly, this was the only association for ``novelty/impact''

\subsection*{Values}

A sigficant goal of data publication is to facilitate reuse of data.
Consequently, we wanted to know what features of a data publication would be useful to researchers in evaulating a dataset's quality.
To address this question, we asked respondents to rate how much confidence each of four possible assurances of data quality inspires.
All of the features inspired at least some confidence in a large majority of researchers (from 89\% to 98\%).
Peer review was easilty the most important factor; 72\% (175) said it conferred complete or high confidence, while only 2\% (4) expressed little or no confidence.
Having been the subject of a traditional paper was second with 56\% (137) complete or high confidence.
Reuse by a third party came in 3rd, with 43\% (106) and description by a data paper was the least convincing at 37\% (89).
The largest fraction of little or no confidence was reuse, at 11\% (25).
%could try to relate peer review confidence to definition, but the results aren't that clear / don't make that much sense

A second significant goal of data publication is to facilitate researcher's getting credit for their datasets.
To that end, we wanted to know what metrics researchers would respect in evaluating the impact of a dataset.
Not surprisingly, citation count was considered to be the most useful metric, with 49\% (119) finding it highly or extremely useful. 
However, downloads also did surprisingly well, at 32\% (77) highly or extremely useful.
If the threshold is dropped to at least somewhat useful, the distinction shrinks further, to 82\% (201) for citations and 73\% (179) for downloads.
Search rank and altmetrics were considered substanially less useful, at 42\% (102) at least somewhat useful for search rank and 37\% (91) for altmetrics, in both cases a minority.

Another way we approached the question of how to attach credit to data publications is to ask how much weight each of a number of generic data publication models would be given as an item on a researcher's CV.
We asked about four models, with or without the imprimatur of peer review or the inclusion of a data paper. 
As a baseline, we also asked about traditional papers.
Not surprisingly, they are highly valued; 60\% (145) give one a great deal of weight and another 36\% (87) give it significant weight.
The most highly weighted data publication, a peer-reviewed data paper, was much less highly valued at only 10\% (23) a great deal of weight, although another 46\% (109) gave it significant weight.
Peer review appeared to be more important than having a data paper. 
Compared to that 10\%, a peer-reviewed dataset with no paper only dropped to 5\% (12), while an un-peer-reviewed data paper dropped to 1\% (2).
A significant proportion of respondents, 27\% (65) would award an un-peer reviewed dataset no weight at all.

For this question, we were particularly interested in the answers of 26\% (59) respondents who had served on a tenure and promotions committee, so we compared their responses to those who had not served on such a committee by chi square.
Values ranged from $\chi^{2}= 7.427$ ($p= 0.12$) for peer-reviewed datasets (valued slightly less by experienced respondents) to $\chi^{2}= 2.097$ ($p= 0.35$) for traditional papers (valued slightly more by experienced respondents); for 5 comparisons, $\alpha=0.01$, and none can be considered statistically significant


\section*{Discussion}

\subsection*{Demographics}

Although this survey was international, a substantial majority of our respondents are affiliated with United States institutions, due in part to signficant response from within the University of California system.
In this respect, our respondents (84\% from North America) are similar to those of Tenopir (2012), who were 73\% from North America.
Several of the more substantial investigations into researcher attitudes toward data sharing, such as those carried out by the Wellcome Trust\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014} and Research Information Network\cite{swan_share_2008} were carried out in the United Kingdom, where the primacy of a single assessment tool, the Research Excellence Framework (REF) is likely to create a significantly different environment.
At least 75\% of respondents in the Wellcome Trust report felt that the REF should recognize data to some or great extent relative to publications, but that it should.

The bulk of our responses (85\%) came from academic institutions, which is similar to Tenopir's 81\%.  
Ceci's intital survey was academic\cite{ceci_scientists_1988}; Scaramozzino's was conducted entirely at California Polytechnic State University, which is teaching-oriented\cite{scaramozzino_study_2012}. 

Our survey covered active researchers with good coverage of all of the major roles in acadmenic research.
Tenopir has 47\% professors, 13.5\% grad students, we have 41\% principle investigator/lab heads and 16\% grad students.
Most other surveys were restricted to PIs.
The most recent UK survey heard from 69\% PIs\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014}.

Our Largest response was from biologists: (37\%), followed by Archaeologists (13\%), Social scientists (13\%), and Environmental scientists (11\%)
Tenopir: most heavily environmental sciences & ecology (36\%), followed by social science (16\%) and biology (14\\%)
we're heavy in biology (37\%), but with a significant representation from Earth and environmental science (16\%) and social science (13\%).
Scaramozzino heard from 18\% biologists, with the highest from physicists and mathematicians.
Swann investigated a restricted set of eight research areas.
The Wellcome survey is also heavy in social science (31.4\%), Epidemiology, (26.8\%), Genetics/genomics (20\%)

Because participation in the survey was entirely voluntary and uncontrolled, responses are almost certainly biased toward researchers with an interest in data sharing and publication related issues.
However, the high proportion of respondents who did not name any data journals (84\%) and the low awareness of US federal policies (35\% of US respondents had never heard of the NSF data management plan requirement and 62\% had never heard of the OSTP Open Data Initiative) suggests that our sample is not extremely biased.
To provide context, 40\% of respondents to the Wellcome Trust survey were unaware of data journals.

\subsection*{Data sharing}

\subsection*{Data publication}

We also found that that's true is no single clear meaning of the term ``data publication'' to researchers.
The most freqently named attribute, open availability, was only chosen by ~2/3 of respondents.
It may be that little has changed since the RIN report concluded that ```publishing' datasets means different things to different researchers''\cite{swan_share_2008}.
One respondent to our survey simply wrote in ``terms are confusing.''
However, the emergence of systematic relationships between some of the features presents demonstrates that the responces were not utterly confused.
We observed two, arguably three, inpedendent conceptions of data publication.
The first centers on preservation and access; the two most popular items, availability and deposition in a repository, were tightly correlated.
Other related features, assigment of a unique ID, and the two items relating to metadata are all correlated with deposition in a repository, and many links exist between those five items.

The second is a traditional conception that data that has been ``published'' is really just data that has been used in a traditional journal article. 
``Basis of a research paper'' was choses by a sizeable proportion (43\%) of respondents.
Interestingly, rather than competing significantly, these two ideas were completely independent.

The third conception is that a published dataset is one that has been described by a data paper.
Data papers are linked to peer review and both kinds of metadata, but not significantly associated with features that have to do with the disposition of the data, such as deposited in a repository or openly available, even though virtually all data paper publishers require both peer review and repository deposition.
Data papers are still not widely familiar to researchers; ``described in a data paper'' was the least popular (22\%) feature selected, and most (84\%) respondents did not name any data journals.
Data papers also confer less trust in a dataset than any other feature we asked about, but only by a small margin; 36\% of respondents derive high or complete confidence from a data paper, compared to 44\% from successful reuse.
Not surprisingly, data papers are much less highly valued than traditional research papers; 60\% of respondents give a traditional paper a great deal of weight, but only 10\% value a data paper that highly.
It may be that data papers will become more valued as awareness spreads; when asked to name data journals, one respondent wrote in ``I've never heard of this, but it sounds fantastic.''
On the other hand it may be that a data paper \emph{should} be valued less than a traditional paper and 55\% would give a data paper at least significant value, so that might be appropriate.
It is clear that a data paper adds value to a dataset, however, when the two are uncoupled, peer review is the bigger factor.
 
\subsection*{Validation}

Commenting on the variable meanings of data publication to researchers, the RIN report of 2008 remarked, ``There is, for some, also an implication that the information has been through a quality control process.''\cite{swan_share_2008} 
The type and degree of quality control is perhaps the most variable aspect of current data publication implementations. 
Substantial trust is attached to the traditional scholarly publication process; researchers expressed a great deal of trust in datasets that had formed the basis of a traditional paper.

Peer review was both the most significant factor in boosting the trustworthiness of dataset, and in boosting the value of dataset lisetd on a CV.
This may, in part, reflect the high proportion of biologists in our survey; biologists value peer review especially highly\cite{harley_assessing_2010}
Although peer review was highly valued, it was not expected by most researchers; 71\% would \textbf{not} expect a published dataset to have been peer-reviewd.
Expectations for peer review seem to be more consistent than for publication, despite one respondents remark that ``I have never heard this term applied to a dataset and I don't know what it means.''
Whereas the top item in the publication definition question was only chosen by ~2/3 of respondents, 90\% of respondents agreed that they would expect peer review to include evaluation of collection and processing methods.
In fact, fully half of the items were chosen by more respondents than the top data publication item.
Natrually, a majority of respondents expect assessments that require domain expertise.
``Data is plausible'' was linked with three other features that require domain knowledge (methods evaluated, sufficient metadata to replicate, and potential impact/novelty).
In general, respondents did not expect peer review to take novelty/impact into account (only 22\%), which is in line with most data peer review guidelines.
We conclude that data publication intitatives that do not incorporate peer review are unlikely to confuse anyone, but that peer review is likely to be critical for data publications to attain a status comparable to that of journal articles.

Based our personal experiences, we were surprised that ``successful reuse'' did not inspire more trust in respondents.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Survey design and distribution}
All results were drawn from a 34-question survey officially open online from January 22nd to February 28 of 2014; two late responses recieved in March were included in the analysis.
The University of California, Berkeley Insitiutional Review Board approved the survey.
The survey could be completed anonymously.
Respondends affiliated with the Univeristy of California had an opportunity to supply an email address for help with data publication, but that information was not used in any way for the purposes of this article.

The survey asked questions in 3 categores: demographics, data sharing experience, and data publication perceptions.
Data publication perceptions consisted of ``mark all that apply'' questions about the definition of data publication and peer review and Likert scale questions about the value of various possible features of a data publication.

The survey was designed with a minimum of required questions.
Some pages were displayed dynamically based on answers to certain questions; therefore, n varies considerably.
The survey was administered as a Google Form.
Solicitations were distributed via social media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+), emails to listservs, and a blog post on Data Pub\cite{kratz_data_2014}.

\subsection*{Data processing and analysis}
Although opinions are unlikely to be controversial, light anonymization was performed prior to analysis.
University of California (UC) affiliation and questions with specific application to UC researchers were redacted.
Respondent locations were grouped into United States and ``Other''; this distinction was preserved because some questions asked about US government policies.  
Sub-disciplines with fewer than three respondents were merged into the corresponding discipline.
Listed data journals were standardized by hand.
Free text answers were replaced with ``Other.''

After anonymization, reponses were filtered for analysis.
Because the goal of the survey was to learn about researchers, we exempted from analysis anyone who self-identified as a librarian or information scientist.
To restrict the analysis to active researchers, we filtered anyone who affirmed that they had not generated any data in the last five years; the 90 respondents who did not answer this question were retained.
Finally, we exempted anyone who did not posess at least a Bachelor's Degree.
In total, 32 respondents were exempted from analysis, some on the basis of multiple criteria.

Analysis was performed using IPython\cite{perez_ipython_2007}, Pandas\cite{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}, and Numpy\cite{van_der_walt_numpy_2011}.
Graphs were prepared using Python and formatted with Adobe Illustrator.
For significance testing, the Fisher exact test was used for 2x2 tables and contingency table chi-square for all larger tables.
A significance cutoff of $\alpha=0.05$ was used, corrected for multiple hypothesis testing when appropriate.
Because few questions were required, questions with no reply at all were considered to be skipped rather than an intentional ``none of these''.
