##Methods

###Ethics

* UC Human Subjects IRB approved this survey
* UC respondents had the option of identifying themselves, but that information is omitted here
* Officially open January 22nd - February 28, 2014.  Got 2 responses in March, last one on the 25th
* Distributed by email, social media (twitter, facebook)
* Open to anyone

###Distribution

* Cover letter with link to survey sent
* *UC campus libraries
* *Librarian Listservs
* Social media
* *twitter
* *facebook
* Blog post on DataPub

###Survey
* Few required questions
* Demographics (minimal)
* Data sharing experiences / attitudes / knowledge
* Data publication perceptions
* *expectations from the terms 'data publication' and 'data peer review'
* *value of various possible DP features in various contexts

###Anonymization

* Location deleted
* UC & campus affiliation redacted
* * knowledge of UC OA mandate redacted
* free text answers standardized
* * data journals converted to standardized list
* * all text boxes associated with 'Other' buttons recoded as 'other', except for a limited number of cases in 'role', where judgement was used to assign the respondent to one of the standard responses
* Subdisciplines with < 3 respondents were merged into the corresponding discipline

###Filtering for analysis

* Removed anyone who self-identified as a librarian
* Removed information scientists
* Removed anyone who said they hadn't generated any data in the last 5 years
* *90 respondents didn't answer.  too many to discard, so we kept them.
* Removed anyone whose highest degree was from highschool
* We filtered out:
* *16 librarians
* *13 information scientists (6 of whom are also librarians)
* *3 without college degrees
* *11 who hadn't generated any data (2 libraians, 1 info scientist)
* *sometimes the same person was filtered by multiple criteria
##Analysis

* Chi-squared was used for all significance testing

##Results


###Demographics

* 281 unique responses   
* 249 (89%) passed filters 
* Largest response from biologists: (37%), followed by Archaeologists (13%), Social scientists (13%), and Environmental scientists (11%)
* Responses from across the carreer spectrum: 41% principle investigator/lab heads, 24% postdocs, and 16% grad students.
* Overwhelmingly, biggest response (85%) from academic institutions, 90% of those are research-focused.


###Sharing background

###Data vultures
* 'data vultures' / being taken advantage of is a concern in data publication 
* we wanted to know how much of a problem it currently is
* we asked respondents whose data had been reused in a publication by someone else "how did you feel about the amount of credit you were given?"
* 86 answered the question
* a majority 63% (54) thought they got the right amount of credit
* 78% (67)thought they got sufficient or too much credit
* 22% (19) were unhappy, 2% (2) got 'very insufficient' credit


###Definitions

###Values

##Discussion

### Data vultures ###
* no judgement implied about whether researcher expectations are reasonable or not


##Our demographics vs. previous surveys
* Tenopir (2011)
* *81% academic vs. our 85%
* *most heavily environmental sciences & ecology (36%), followed by social sciences (16%) and biology (14%)
