\section*{Abstract}

Data ``publication'' seeks to appropriate the prestige of authorship in the peer-reviewed literature as a reward for creators of a useful and well documented datasets. 
Data publication has been embraced as a means to promote data sharing and numerous initita, but the conversation in the scholarly communication community around what a data publication should be and how data peer review should work is ongoing. 
To contribute an important and neglected perspective, we surveyed ~250 researchers across the sciences and social sciences, asking what expectations``data publication'' raises and what features would be useful to evaluate the trustworthiness and impact of a data publication and the contribution of its creator(s).  
We found that expectations of data publication center on availability.
Most respondents did not expect published data to be peer-reviewed, but peer review was the significant source of trust and value for a published dataset.


\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{Data sharing}

In 1985--- almost 30 years ago--- Stephen Ceci surveyed 847 scientists and concluded, ``it is clear that scientists in all fields endorse the principle of data sharing as a desirable norm of science''\cite{ceci_scientists_1988}.
This endorsement has not weakened in the intervening decades; the importance of data sharing was affirmed in 2010 by more than 65\% of faculty at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly)\cite{scaramozzino_study_2012} and in 2013 by 94\% of researchers survyed by the Expert Advisor Gorup on Data Access (EAGDA) in the United Kingdom (UK)\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014}.
The respondents in 1985 advocated data sharing ``to allow replication and extension of one's own findings''\cite{ceci_scientists_2014}, and data sharing is motived in general by the twin affordances of reproducibility and (re)use.
The reproducibility problem that is currently embarassing science in the scholarly\cite{ioannidis_why_2005, prinz_believe_2011, mobley_survey_2013} and mainstream\cite{zimmer_rise_2013, _how_2013, _trouble_2013} press could be addressed, in part, by opening data to scrutiny\cite{drew_lost_2013, collins_policy_2014}.
Beyond reproducing previous analysis, reuse of existing data cuts research costs\cite{piwowar_data_2011} and enables questions to be addressed that wouldn't be possible otherwise\cite{FIND_SOMETHING}.
Despite enthusiasm for data sharing in principle, Ceci alleges that in practice, ``something is amiss in the academy.''

Researchers frequently don't make data available, even when they support the idea or are theoretically obliged to do so.
Alsheikh-Ali et al. (2011) examined 351 articles and found that 59\% did not adhere to the data availability requirements of the journal where they were published.
Vines et al. (2014) requested data from 516 articles published between 1991 and 2011 and got it less than half (47\%) of the time\cite{vines_availability_2014}
Researchers themselves agree that this is a problem.
In 1985, 59\% of scientists surveyed by DataONE complained that their colleagues were disinclined to share data\cite{ceci_scientists_1988}
Fifteen years later, 67\% of respondents to an international survey agreed that ``[l]ack of access to data generated by other researchers or institutions is a major impediment to progress in science'' and 50\% felt that their own research had suffered\cite{tenopir_data_2011}.
That same year, 65\% Cal Poly faculty claimed that data sharing is important, but less than half of those followed through with their own data\cite{scaramozzino_study_2012}.

Why do even researchers who believe that data sharing is important not do it?
Previous surveys unearthed a number of reasons: concern about the ethical and legal issues encrusting human subject data, mistrust of that others have the expertise to use the data appropriately, hope of wringing more articles from the dataset, and fear that the data will be ``stolen'' without credit or acknowledgment.
Researchers expressed ethical concerns in reports from the Research Information Network (RIN) in 2008 and EAGDA in 2014; in the 2014 report, this was the second most frequently mentioned constraint (by 55\% of respondents)\cite{swann_share_2008, bobrow_establishing_2014}.
The risk of losing publications from premature sharing came up in 60\% of a 2012 series of interviews of United States (US) scientists, more than any other risk; fear of ``data theft'' was mentioned in 32\% of the interviews\cite{kim_institutional_2012}.
However, by far the most consistent reason given is that preparing and documenting data to a high enough standard to be useful just takes too much time.

In the UK, RIN report described lack of time as a major constraint\cite{swan_share_2008} and in the EAGDA report, it was the most frequently mentioned constraint (by 66\% of respondents)\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014}.
Time was the most often mentioned (by 44\%) unavoidable cost (as opposed to potential risk) to data sharing in Kim and Stanton's survey\cite{kim_institutional_2012} and the most frequent reason for not sharing data in the DataONE survey (by 54\% of respondents)\cite{tenopir_data_2011}.
Although the process of preparing and documenting data for sharing to be shared openly could undoubtedly be streamlined with better planning, education, and tools, it will always take time and effort.
The underlying problem is that this effort is not rewarded.
In the EAGDA report, 55\% of respondents said that lack of tangible recognition and rewards constrains data sharing, and at least 75\% of respondents felt that the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) does not recognize data to some or great extent relative to publications, but that it should.
The need to compensate researchers who share data with scholarly prestige is a major driver of the movement toward data publication.
 
\subsection*{Data publication}
 
Data publication appropriates terminology (``publication'', ``peer review'') from the scholarly literature to integrate data into the academic reward system\cite{costello_motivating_2009, lawrence_data_2011, atici_other_2012}.
The model of data publication that most closely mimics the existing literature is the data paper.
Data papers describe datasets, including the rationale and collections methods, without offering any analysis or conclusions\cite{newman_data_2009, callaghan_processes_2013}.
Data papers are colonizing existing journals like \emph{F1000Research} and \emph{Internet Archaeology} and founding dedicated journals such as \emph{Earth System Science Data}, \emph{Geoscience Data Journal}\cite{allan_geoscience_2014}, and Nature Publishing Group's \emph{Scientific Data}--- which describes itself concisely as ``a publication venue that credits scientists who share and explain their data." \cite{_more_2014}
Data papers are inveitably peer-reviewed based on the dataset; its description; and whether the two form a complete, consistent, and useable package\cite{lawrence_data_2011}.
The appeal data papers is straighforward: they are unquestionably peer-reviewed papers, so academia knows how (if perhaps not how much) to value them.

However, data papers are by no means the only approach to data publication.
Data publishers include repositories such as Dryad(http://www.datadryad.org/), figshare(http://figshare.com/), and Zenodo(http://zenodo.org/) where researchers can self-deposit any kind of research data with light documentation requirements and minimal validation; Dyrad requires that the data be associated with a ``reputable'' publication, while figshare and Zenodo are completely open.
Domain-specific repositories frequently have more stringent documentation requirements and access to the domain knowledge needed thorough evalutation.
For instance, The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) evaluates incoming data in a complex bearuocratic process that incorporates both internal technical expertise and external domain knowledge\cite{weaver_data_2012}.
As a final example, Open Context publishes carefully processed and richly annotated archaeology data, some of which passes through editorial and peer review\cite{kansa_we_2014}.
One thing that all of these publisher have in common is that they endeavor to make datasets formally citable (in part through assignment of stable identifiers) as a means to credit the creators.

The variety of forms of data publication attests to a general shortage of consensus on what, exactly, it means to publish data.
Noting a lack of both consensus and interest on the part of researchers, the RIN report of 2008 adopted a deliberately minimal definition, ``making datasets publicly available''\cite{swan_share_2008}.
While emminently practical, this definition does not do much to distinguish publication from sharing (except for ruling out certain channels) or to advance its prestige.
More recently, Callaghan et al. (2012) suggesting distinguishing between shared (available), \underline{p}ublished (also citable), and \underline{P}ublished (also peer-reviewed) data\cite{callaghan_making_2012}.
We have argued that the consensus in the scholarly communication community is that published data is openly available and citable, but that what kind of validation (if any) is required to qualify is still an open question\cite{kratz_data_2014}.
It is easy to forget, however, that what data publication means to the scholarly communication community is substantially irrelevant.
The point of calling data that has been made public through whatever particular process ``published'' is to exploit the meaning of the word to researchers; the important definition is what data publication means to them. 

Researchers have been surveyed about data sharing many times this decade, but not about data publication\cite{harley_assessing_2010, westra_data_2010, tenopir_data_2011, kim_institutional_2012, scaramozzino_study_2012, williams_gathering_2013, bobrow_establishing_2014, strasser_dataup_2014}
The RIN report of 2008 is the last survey to ask researchers about data publication; while the conclusions are undeniably valuable, as mentioned above, it uses the term broadly, such that it is difficult to make any distinction between attitutdes about sharing data and about publishing it\cite{swan_share_2008}.
Consequently, open questions abound:
What would a researcher expect data publication to mean?
What about peer review of a dataset?
Do current models satisfy those expectations?
What potential features of a data publication would be useful for evaluating the quality of the data?
For evaluating the contribution of the creator(s)?
To get this critical perspective we conducted an online survey of active researcher perceptions of data publication.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Demographics}

We collected responses to an online survey of data publication practices and perceptions in January and February of 2014 and received 281 unique responses.
Because we distributed the survey solicitation via social media and email listservs and did not contact most recipients directly, we cannot estimate with any accuracy how many researchers recieved the solicitation or calculate a response rate.
Our analysis was restricted to the 249 (81\%) respondents who we deemed to be active researchers (summarized in Table 1).
Researchers from 20 countries responded, but most ($79\%, n=197$) were affiliated with insitutions in the US.
The institutions were largely academic ($85\%, n=XXX$); 90\% ($n=XXX$) of those were focused on research rather than teaching. 
The largest response was from Biologists (37\%), followed by Arch{\ae}ologists (13\%), Social scientists (13\%), and Environmental scientists (11\%).
We heard from researchers accross the academic career spectrum: 41\% ($n=XXX$) were principal investigators/lab heads, 24\% ($n=XXX$) postdocs, and 16\% ($n=XXX$) grad students.
We saw surprisingly few significant differences in responses between disciplines or roles, so we have generally presented the results in aggregate.

\subsection*{Background knowledge}

We asked a number of questions to assess engagement and familiarity with data sharing and publication.
Respondents rated their familiarity with three US federal government policies related to data sharing and availability.
Because the policies are specific to the US, we restricted our analysis to the respondents who work in the US.
Respondents were most familiar with the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Data Management Plan requirement\cite{national_science_foundation_gpg_2011}.
Less than half had heard of the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Open Data Initiative\cite{obama_making_2013} at all; although the directive will eventually affect virtually all researchers who recieve US government funding, awareness is most likely low because concrete policies have not been implemented yet.
A much older policy, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) data sharing policy\cite{national_institutes_of_health_final_2003} was enacted 11 years ago, but only 4 biologists ($5\%$) claimed to know all the details, fewer than the 18 ($24\%$) who had never heard of it.

The rapid proliferation of data journals led us to ask about them specifically.
Respondents listed any data journals that they could name in a free text box.
Only 16\% ($n=XXX$) of respondents named any data journals. 
\emph{Ecological Archives} was the most frequently named, by 16 respondents. 
The second most frequent response was Nature Publishing Group's \emph{Scientific Data} (named by 14), even though it had not started publishing at the time of the survey.
\emph{Earth System Science Data (ESSD)} (7), \emph{Biodiversity Data Journal} (6) and \emph{Geoscience Data Journal} (5) followed.
A number of respondents listed non-journal data publishers: figshare (6), Dryad (3), and Zenodo(1).

\subsection*{Data sharing mechanisms}

Data publication is a relatively new and unfamiliar concept to researchers, but most do have experience with and opinions about data sharing, and we explored those before moving on to publication.
Many respondents ($56\%, n=140$) said that it is very important to share the data that underlies a study; differences between disciplines were not statistically meaningful ($\chi^{2}= 39.1, p= 0.18$). %Check that these values makes sense!
Most have experience sharing data ($68\%, n=168$) or reusing shared data ($61\%, n=151$).
Of the researchers who shared, 58\% ($n=98$) saw their data reused by someone and 62\% ($n=61$) of those reuses led to a published paper.
Most of the reusers published a paper with the data ($69\%, n=104$).

Because the channel of sharing is a crucial feature of data publication\cite{kratz_data_2014} we asked researchers with data sharing experience about the meduim of transmission (Figure 2).
The supplied answer choices were the four methods for external data sharing that emerged in interviews by Kim and Stanton\cite{kim_institutional_2012}: email/direct contact, personal website, journal website, and database or repository.
Email/direct contact was the most frequently reported method for sharing; 87\% ($n=146$) shared data that way, 82\% ($n=82$) of other researchers obtained the repondent's data that way, and 57\% ($n=86$) of the respondents who reused data got it way.
Eight respondents (5\%) wrote-in an analog channel we that had not considered; they extracted data from the text, tables, or figures of a published paper.

\subsection*{Data sharing credit}

Crediting data creators is a primary concern in data publication, so we asked how a dataset creator should be credited by a reuser (Figure 3A).
Additionally, we asked those who had published with shared data how they actually credited the creator (Figure 3B).
The most common answer to the theoretical question, from 83\% ($n=126$) of respondents, was formal citation in the reference list.
Acknowledgement also ranked highly at 62\% (93).
Most respondents who gave a free-text answer wrote some variant on ``it depends.''
They cited two factors: the publication status of the dataset (e.g. ``depends on whether the data is already published'') and the role of the data in the paper (e.g. ``authorship if data is [the] primary source of analysis, otherwise acknowledgment'').
Because previous studies reported differences in culture between disciplines\cite{swan_share_2008, harley_assessing_2010, tenopir_data_2011}, we tested whether discipline had a significant effect on the response  (omitting Mathematics because of low $n$) and found that it did not ($\chi^{2}= 15.6, p= 0.9$).
Reported practice fit well with theory: formal citation was the most popular method ($63\%, n=81$), followed by acknowledgment (LOOK UP).
There was, however, a statistically significant ($\chi^{2}= 15.8, p= 0.0013$) difference between answers to the two questions.
The likely source of this distinction is that while a a few repondents ($16\%, n=24$) felt that it was appropriate to cite data informally in the body of the text, none said that they had actually done it.
In direct contrast, study of the literature shows that informal citation is actually the most common approach\cite{sieber_not_1995, mooney_anatomy_2012}.

Many researchers fear that shared data might be used by ``data vultures'' who contribute little and don't acknowledge the source\cite{kim_insitutional_2012}.
To assess whether this fear is well founded, we asked respondents whose data had been reused for a publication whether they were adequately credited (Figure 3C).
Most ($63\%, n=54$) felt appropriately credited, and a combined 78\% ($n=67$) felt the credit was appropriate or excessive.
This left 22\% ($n=13$) who were unsatisfied; only 2 (2\%) felt that the credit was ``very insufficient.''
These differences in satisfaction could derive from different attitudes toward appropriate credit.  
To test this, we collapsed responses into three categories (insufficient, appropriate, and excessive), and tested for independence with each of the four specified answers in data sharing credit.
The strongest relationship, between less satisfaction and belief that authorship is appropriate, was still far from statistically meaningful ($\chi^{2}= 3.26, p= 0.20$, corrected $\$alpha= 0.0125$).

\subsection*{Definitions}

The central question we hoped to answer is what ``data publication'' and ``data peer review'' actually mean to researchers.
We decomposed the prevalent models of data publication into a set of possible features and asked which would be expected to distinguish a ``published'' dataset from a ``shared'' one (Figure XXXA).
Not surprisingly, the most common expectations relate to access: 68\% (166) expect a published dataset to be openly available and 54\% (133) expect it to have been deposited in a repository.
More researchers expected a published dataset to accompanied by a traditional publication (43\%, 105) than a data paper (22\%, 55).
Perhaps surprisingly, only a 29\% (70) minority expect published data to have been peer reviewed.

To find out what researchers expected from data peer review, we asked what they would expect peer review of data to entail and provided a list of considerations that various organizations take into account when evaluating/validating datasets (Figure XXXB).
The most common responses were ``collection and processing methods were evaluated'' (90\%, 220) and ``descriptive text is thorough enough to use or replicate the dataset'' (80\%, 196).
The high rank of the latter suggests an awareness of the importance of metadata.
Fitting with current practice, there was little (22\%, 53) expectation that peer review would consider the novelty or potential impact of the dataset.
An expectation that data publication includes peer review correlated positively (by Fisher exact test) with thorough descriptive text ($OR= 5.67, p= 0.00029$), plausibility considered ($OR= 2.29, p= 0.0087$), and novelty/impact considered ($OR= 2.42, p= 0.0092$), although only the first edges over an $\alpha= 0.05$ significance threshold after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing.

We were interested in whether selections of items in each definition represented coherent ideas about publication or peer review, so we tested agains the null hypothesis that each item was selected (or not) independently of every other.
Not surprisingly, this hypothesis was rejected resoundingly for both data publication ($\chi^{2}$= 290.0, $p= 6.9\times10^{-58}$) and peer review ($\chi^{2}= 343.0, p= 5.7\times10^{-72}$) by chi square tests.
To identify specific correlations, we performed pairwise Fisher exact tests between each feature (Figure XXX).
We found a dense set of statistically significant (at the $\alpha= 0.05$ level, corrected to 0.0018) associates among features related to access and preservation.
For instance, ``deposited in a repository'' was linked to ``openly available'' ($OR=9.55, p= 7.6\times10^{-14}$), unique ID ($OR= 3.33, p= 1.33\times10^{-5}$), formal ($OR= 4.49, p= 3.94\times10^{-6}$) and rich ($OR= 3.83, p=1.14\times10^{-6}$) metadata.
We were unsurprised to find linkages between formal and rich metadata ($OR= 12.5, p= 2.7\times10^{-14}$) and between assignment of a unique ID and formal metadata ($OR= 7.92, p= 5.05\times10^{-11}$).
Data papers were linked to both rich ($OR=3.64, p=4.22\times10^{-5}$) and formal ($OR=4.30, p=1.32\times10^{-5}$) metadata.
Data papers were also the only feature associated with peer review ($OR=3.00, p=0.0011$).
``Basis of a traditional paper'' had no significant associations; the closest was with data paper ($OR=1.93, p=0.023$).

We also found multiple significant relationships among possible considerations for peer review, with a corrected cutoff of $\alpha=0.0033$.
Three strong correlations formed a triangle from ``methods are appropriate'' to ``Metadata standardized'' ($OR=7.91, p=0.00081$) to ``Technical details check out'' ($OR=4.56, p=3.4\times10^{-6}$) to ``methods are appropriate'' ($OR=5.9, p=7.9\times10^{-5}$).
``Data is plausible'' correlated with other factors that require domain expertise: ``methods are appropriate'' ($OR=4.51, p=0.0014$), ``metadata sufficient for replication'' ($OR=4.87, p=2.5\time10^{-6}$), and ``novelty/impact'' ($OR=5.50, p=1.1\times10^{-5}$).
Interestingly, this was the only association for ``novelty/impact''

\subsection*{Values}

A significant goal of data publication is to facilitate reuse of data.
Consequently, we wanted to know what features of a data publication would be useful to researchers in evaulating a dataset's quality.
To address this question, we asked respondents to rate how much confidence each of four possible assurances of data quality inspires.
All of the features inspired at least some confidence in a large majority of researchers (from 89\% to 98\%).
Peer review was easily the most important factor; 72\% (175) said it conferred complete or high confidence, while only 2\% (4) expressed little or no confidence.
Having been the subject of a traditional paper was second with 56\% (137) complete or high confidence.
Reuse by a third party came in 3rd, with 43\% (106) and description by a data paper was the least convincing at 37\% (89).
The largest fraction of little or no confidence was reuse, at 11\% (25).
%could try to relate peer review confidence to definition, but the results aren't that clear / don't make that much sense

A second significant goal of data publication is to facilitate researcher's getting credit for their datasets.
To that end, we wanted to know what metrics researchers would respect in evaluating the impact of a dataset.
Not surprisingly, citation count was considered to be the most useful metric, with 49\% (119) finding it highly or extremely useful. 
However, downloads also did surprisingly well, at 32\% (77) highly or extremely useful.
If the threshold is dropped to at least somewhat useful, the distinction shrinks further, to 82\% (201) for citations and 73\% (179) for downloads.
Search rank and altmetrics were considered substantially less useful, at 42\% (102) at least somewhat useful for search rank and 37\% (91) for altmetrics, in both cases a minority.

Another way we approached the question of how to attach credit to data publications is to ask how much weight each of a number of generic data publication models would be given as an item on a researcher's CV.
We asked about four models, with or without the imprimatur of peer review or the inclusion of a data paper. 
As a baseline, we also asked about traditional papers.
Not surprisingly, they are highly valued; 60\% (145) give one a great deal of weight and another 36\% (87) give it significant weight.
The most highly weighted data publication, a peer-reviewed data paper, was much less highly valued at only 10\% (23) a great deal of weight, although another 46\% (109) gave it significant weight.
Peer review appeared to be more important than having a data paper. 
Compared to that 10\%, a peer-reviewed dataset with no paper only dropped to 5\% (12), while an un-peer-reviewed data paper dropped to 1\% (2).
A significant proportion of respondents, 27\% (65) would award an un-peer reviewed dataset no weight at all.

For this question, we were particularly interested in the answers of 26\% (59) respondents who had served on a tenure and promotions committee, so we compared their responses to those who had not served on such a committee by chi square.
Values ranged from $\chi^{2}= 7.427$ ($p= 0.12$) for peer-reviewed datasets (valued slightly less by experienced respondents) to $\chi^{2}= 2.097$ ($p= 0.35$) for traditional papers (valued slightly more by experienced respondents); for 5 comparisons, $\alpha=0.01$, and none can be considered statistically significant


\section*{Discussion}

\subsection*{Demographics}

Although this survey was international, a substantial majority of our respondents are affiliated with United States institutions, due in part to significant response from within the University of California system.
In this respect, our respondents (84\% from North America) are similar to those of Tenopir (2012), who were 73\% from North America.
Several of the more substantial investigations into researcher attitudes toward data sharing, such as those carried out by the Wellcome Trust\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014} and Research Information Network\cite{swan_share_2008} were carried out in the United Kingdom, where the primacy of a single assessment tool, the Research Excellence Framework (REF) is likely to create a significantly different environment.
At least 75\% of respondents in the Wellcome Trust report felt that the REF should recognize data to some or great extent relative to publications, but that it should.

The bulk of our responses (85\%) came from academic institutions, which is similar to Tenopir's 81\%.  
Ceci's initial survey was academic\cite{ceci_scientists_1988}; Scaramozzino's was conducted entirely at California Polytechnic State University, which is teaching-oriented\cite{scaramozzino_study_2012}. 

Our survey covered active researchers with good coverage of all of the major roles in academic research.
Tenopir has 47\% professors, 13.5\% grad students, we have 41\% principle investigator/lab heads and 16\% grad students.
Most other surveys were restricted to PIs.
The most recent UK survey heard from 69\% PIs\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014}.

Our Largest response was from biologists: (37\%), followed by Archaeologists (13\%), Social scientists (13\%), and Environmental scientists (11\%). 
Tenopir is most heavily environmental sciences and ecology (36\%), followed by social science (16\%) and biology (14\%). 
We're heavy in biology (37\%), but with a significant representation from Earth and environmental science (16\%) and social science (13\%). 
Scaramozzino heard from 18\% biologists, with the highest from physicists and mathematicians.
Swann investigated a restricted set of eight research areas.
The Wellcome survey is also heavy in social science (31.4\%), Epidemiology, (26.8\%), Genetics/genomics (20\%)

Because participation in the survey was entirely voluntary and uncontrolled, responses are almost certainly biased toward researchers with an interest in data sharing and publication related issues.
However, the high proportion of respondents who did not name any data journals (84\%) and the low awareness of US federal policies (35\% of US respondents had never heard of the NSF data management plan requirement and 62\% had never heard of the OSTP Open Data Initiative) suggests that our sample is not extremely biased.
To provide context, 40\% of respondents to the Wellcome Trust survey were unaware of data journals.


\subsection*{Data publication}

We found that there  is no single clear meaning of the term ``data publication'' to researchers.
The most frequently named attribute, open availability, was only chosen by ~2/3 of respondents.
It may be that little has changed since the RIN report concluded that ```publishing' datasets means different things to different researchers''\cite{swan_share_2008}.
One respondent to our survey simply wrote in ``terms are confusing.''
However, the emergence of systematic relationships between some of the features presents demonstrates that the responses were not utterly confused.
We observed two, arguably three, independent conceptions of data publication.
The first centers on preservation and access; the two most popular items, availability and deposition in a repository, were tightly correlated.
Other related features, assignment of a unique ID, and the two items relating to metadata are all correlated with deposition in a repository, and many links exist between those five items.
This idea maps well onto virtually all present data publication implementations.

The second is a traditional conception that data that has been ``published'' is really just data that has been used in a traditional journal article. 
``Basis of a research paper'' was choses by a sizable proportion (43\%) of respondents.
Interestingly, rather than competing significantly, these two ideas were completely independent.
This idea doesn't really match the conversation in the scholarly community; while a great deal of published data (in, e.g. Dryad) has been used by a traditional article, data that had been used but not made available has not been published.

The third conception is that a published dataset is one that has been described by a data paper.
Data papers are linked to peer review and both kinds of metadata, but not significantly associated with features that have to do with the disposition of the data, such as deposited in a repository or openly available, even though virtually all data paper publishers require both peer review and repository deposition.
Data papers are still not widely familiar to researchers; ``described in a data paper'' was the least popular (22\%) feature selected, and most (84\%) respondents did not name any data journals.
Data papers also confer less trust in a dataset than any other feature we asked about, but only by a small margin; 36\% of respondents derive high or complete confidence from a data paper, compared to 44\% from successful reuse.
Not surprisingly, data papers are much less highly valued than traditional research papers; 60\% of respondents give a traditional paper a great deal of weight, but only 10\% value a data paper that highly.
It may be that data papers will become more valued as awareness spreads; when asked to name data journals, one respondent wrote in ``I've never heard of this, but it sounds fantastic.''
On the other hand it may be that a data paper \emph{should} be valued less than a traditional paper and 55\% would give a data paper at least significant value, so that might be appropriate.
It is clear that a data paper adds value to a dataset, however, when the two are uncoupled, peer review is the bigger factor.
 
\subsection*{Data validation}

The type and degree of quality control is perhaps the most variable aspect of current data publication implementations. 
Commenting on the variable meanings of data publication to researchers, the RIN report of 2008 remarked, ``[t]here is, for some, also an implication that the information has been through a quality control process.''\cite{swan_share_2008}
Substantial trust is attached to the traditional scholarly publication process; researchers expressed a great deal of trust in datasets that had formed the basis of a traditional paper.

Peer review was both the most significant factor in boosting the trustworthiness of dataset, and in boosting the value of dataset listed on a CV.
This may, in part, reflect the high proportion of biologists in our survey; biologists value peer review especially highly\cite{harley_assessing_2010}
Although peer review was highly valued, it was not expected by most researchers; 71\% would \textbf{not} expect a published dataset to have been peer-reviewed.
Expectations for peer review seem to be more consistent than for publication, despite one respondents remark that ``I have never heard this term applied to a dataset and I don't know what it means.''
Whereas the top item in the publication definition question was only chosen by ~2/3 of respondents, 90\% of respondents agreed that they would expect peer review to include evaluation of collection and processing methods.
In fact, fully half of the items were chosen by more respondents than the top data publication item.
Naturally, a majority of respondents expect assessments that require domain expertise.
``Data is plausible'' was linked with three other features that require domain knowledge (methods evaluated, sufficient metadata to replicate, and potential impact/novelty).
In general, respondents did not expect peer review to take novelty/impact into account (only 22\%), which is in line with most data peer review guidelines.
We conclude that data publication initiatives that do not incorporate peer review are unlikely to confuse anyone, but that peer review is likely to be critical for data publications to attain a status comparable to that of journal articles.

Based on our personal experiences, we were surprised that ``successful reuse'' did not inspire more trust in respondents.
The idea that ``data use in its own right provides a form of review''\cite{parsons_data_2010} is frequently put forward in discussions of data publication, but successful reuse rated below both peer review and ``basis of a traditional paper'' as a means of establishing trust in a dataset.
It's worth nothing that ``basis of a traditional paper'' is, itself, evidence of use.
Interestingly, citations, a direct consequence of successful reuse, were the most useful metric for assessing data value/impact.
The seeming disconnect could be the result of different ideas about what constitutes successful reuse vs. where a citation comes from, or the difference between trustworthiness and impact.
Combined, the value of reuse/citations for increasing trust in dataset reusers and establishing the value of the creators work makes reuse as review highly worthwhile, but it does appear that it can't substitute for peer review.

\subsection*{Credit for data}

The scholarly communication community agrees that data should be cited formally in the reference list,\cite{force11_data_citation_synthesis_group_joint_2014} but past studies found that this is rarely actually done.\cite{sieber_not_1995, mooney_citing_2011, mooney_anatomy_2012}
In a 1995 survey of 198 papers that used published datasets, 18.7\% cited the dataset with at least its title in the reference list\cite{sieber_not_1995}, and a followup 17 years later found, with 16.9\% meeting this low standard, that practice had not improved.\cite{mooney_anatomy_2012}
The most common taken approach is informal citation in the methods or results section of the paper; 30.8\% of papers in 1995 and 69.2\% in 2012 included at least the title in their text.
Despite this dismal state of affairs, in this survey, most respondents affirmed that formal citation is the correct approach.
Formal citation was the most common response to how a dataset creator should be credited (83\%) and to how the respondent actually credited data creators (63\%).
Furthermore, no one admitted to informally citing data in the text of a paper.
It may be that our respondents were particularly conscientious, that significant forms of credit are easier to remember, or that researchers are operating on somewhat different definitions of what constitutes a dataset or reuse than the authors of the surveys based on examining papers.
It is entirely possible, for instance, that a biologist who uses a sequence from GenBank would not think of such a thing as a dataset or of their activity as reuse.
The Wellcome Trust report found that 71\% of their respondents already tracked use of their datasets ``through details of publications generated using the data.''\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014} 
This suggests that efforts to advance data citation should focus on implementation, rather than making the case in the first place.

While citations were considered the most reliable metric of a dataset's value, download counts were also valued quite highly.
Furthermore, 43\% of respondents to the Wellcome Trust survey track downloads of their datasets\cite{bobrow_establishing_2014}
It can be considerably easier for a repository to count downloads than to harvest citations, so download counts represent ``low hanging fruit'' in terms of data metrics.
On the other hand, appreciation of altmetrics was quite low; few gave them much weight, but a majority gave them a little.
Altmetrics are still very much in development for papers, so it is perhaps not surprising that researchers don't know what to make of them with data.
There is certainly no harm in providing altmetrics for datasets, but in the short term, they are unlikely to add much credibility.

Fear of data theft without credit was the biggest risk preying on researcher's minds (32\% of their minds, to be more precise) in Kim and Stanton's survey of 2012.\cite{kim_institutional_2012}
To try to get a sense of how well-founded these fears are, we asked researchers how they felt about the credit they got the last time someone else published using their data.
While the majority felt that they got the right amount of credit, the fraction that felt shortchanged (22\%) is too large to ignore, and we have to conclude that this is a real problem.
We make no judgment here about whether the expectations of the unsatisfied researchers are reasonable or not, but we did not find any significant differences between satisfied and unsatisfied respondents in the view of how a dataset should be credited.
As time goes on, discipline-specific data-use etiquette may solidify, reducing the problem.
An expectation of authorship may always be a problem.
However, enabling and encouraging data citation can only help.  

\subsection*{Data publication redux}

The results of this survey provide some practical guidance for how data publication implementations can meet researcher expectations and provide the most value possible.
Above all else, researchers expect published data to be accessible, and, secondarily to be deposited in a repository; this fits with current practice and with the most fundamental idea of publication.
Data publications must enable formal citation; researchers felt that this was the most appropriate way to credit a dataset creator in theory and practice.
Tracking citations to a dataset is valuable for evaluating the quality and impact of a dataset; however, download counts are also valuable for assessing impact and may be easier to implement.
Data publications that include a data paper are more valued as CV items and better trusted; this may be, at least in part, because they are associated with peer review.
Peer review is not an essential component of data publication in researchers minds, but it continues to be the gold standard in researchers minds for both trustworthiness and value, and data publishers would be well advised to provide it if possible.
What peer review of data means is still unclear, but two clear expectations are that true peers will supply domain expertise in their field and that evaluation of metadata will play a significant role.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Survey design and distribution}
All results were drawn from a 34-question survey officially open online from January 22nd to February 28 of 2014; two late responses received in March were included in the analysis.
The University of California, Berkeley Institutional Review Board approved the survey.
The survey could be completed anonymously.
Respondents affiliated with the University of California had an opportunity to supply an email address for help with data publication, but that information was not used in any way for the purposes of this article.

The survey asked questions in 3 categories: demographics, data sharing experience, and data publication perceptions.
Data publication perceptions consisted of ``mark all that apply'' questions about the definition of data publication and peer review and Likert scale questions about the value of various possible features of a data publication.

The survey was designed with a minimum of required questions.
Some pages were displayed dynamically based on answers to certain questions; therefore, n varies considerably.
The survey was administered as a Google Form.
Solicitations were distributed via social media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+), emails to listservs, and a blog post on Data Pub\cite{kratz_data_2014}.

\subsection*{Data processing and analysis}
Although opinions are unlikely to be controversial, light anonymization was performed prior to analysis.
University of California (UC) affiliation and questions with specific application to UC researchers were redacted.
Respondent locations were grouped into United States and ``Other''; this distinction was preserved because some questions asked about US government policies.  
Sub-disciplines with fewer than three respondents were merged into the corresponding discipline.
Listed data journals were standardized by hand.
Free text answers were replaced with ``Other.''

After anonymization, responses were filtered for analysis.
Because the goal of the survey was to learn about researchers, we exempted from analysis anyone who self-identified as a librarian or information scientist.
To restrict the analysis to active researchers, we filtered anyone who affirmed that they had not generated any data in the last five years; the 90 respondents who did not answer this question were retained.
Finally, we exempted anyone who did not possess at least a Bachelor's Degree.
In total, 32 respondents were exempted from analysis, some on the basis of multiple criteria.

Analysis was performed using IPython\cite{perez_ipython_2007}, Pandas\cite{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}, and Numpy\cite{van_der_walt_numpy_2011}.
Graphs were prepared using Python and formatted with Adobe Illustrator.
For significance testing, the Fisher exact test was used for 2x2 tables and contingency table chi-square for all larger tables.
A significance cutoff of $\alpha=0.05$ was used, corrected for multiple hypothesis testing when appropriate.
Because few questions were required, questions with no reply at all were considered to be skipped rather than an intentional ``none of these''.
